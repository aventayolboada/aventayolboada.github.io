## About me

I am PhD student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am originally from Sabadell, a town just 15mi north of Barcelona. Over the last few years I've lived in Poland, Wales, and England, before crossing the pond to the United States in 2017. I use he/him/his pronouns in English. 

I am a field linguist, who approaches language through multiple lenses and methodologies: I combine computational methods, corpus analysis, psycholinguistic experiments, and sociolinguistic interviews. 
My current research explores the processes of language maintenance and language change in Indigenous diaspora communities, both nationally and transnationally. I collaborate with the Ã‘uu Savi (Mixtec) diaspora community in California's Central Coast, and with the Wadul and Odul (Yukaghir) communities in Northeastern Siberia.  

In 2013 I graduated with a BA in Linguistics and minors in Polish and Russian from the [University of Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/en/). 
I gained my MA in Cognitive Linguistics from [Bangor University](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/international-homepage) in 2015 and before joining the Department of Linguistics at UC Santa Barbara, 
I taught Catalan at the University of Cambridge with a Batista i Roca Fellowship from [Fitzwilliam College](https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/), [Institut Ramon Llull](https://www.llull.cat/english/home/index.cfm) and the [Valencian Language Academy](https://www.avl.gva.es/).
